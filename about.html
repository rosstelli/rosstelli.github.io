title: About Me
---


<p class="paragraph1">
My name is Ross Donatelli and this section will describe me more personally.
I was born in California, and moved to the east coast of Florida
when I was 6. In elementary school, I began my favorite hobby,
playing guitar. During high school, I began swimming and was a varsity
swimmer for all four years. During my senior year, I won the 100 yard
breaststroke at regionals, and placed 10th place at state. I also participated
in a math competition for the Mu Alpha Theta math club.
</p>

<p class="paragraph1">
I decided to do an "unconventional" undergraduate major, as I had an interest
in biology, as well as a natural ability for mathematics. At Florida Tech, I
swam for 2 years, participated in 2 REUs, and 1 internship, as well as joined a
fraternity, AT&Omega;.
</p>

<p class="paragraph1">
I continue to spend my free time studying, working on code, and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7DDJs1ouT8U" target="_blank">playing guitar</a>.
I enjoy reading artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, as well
as any genomic or proteomic-oriented algorithms. I have projects in the projects
section, where I dabbled in small questions I had.
