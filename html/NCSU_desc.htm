<p class="paragraph1">
Worked on a project titled
<em>
Computational Model of the Thyroid Hormone
Homeostasis and its Manipulation by Chemicals</em>.
</p>
<p class="paragraph1">Created a PBPK Model describing the dynamics of PTU in the body.
The model was the first of its kind as the project used two models, one overall
to model the flow of PTU throughout the body, and a second to model the
impact of PTU on the thyroid.  </p>
