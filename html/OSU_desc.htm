During my time at Ohio State, I mainly worked on a project that was titled
<em>
Numerical Methods for Determining Multistationarity
in Chemical Reaction Networks</em>.
The development of the functionality can be seen on
<a href="http://control.math.wvu.edu/control/" target="_blank">CoNtRol</a>,
however my changes are not visible. I worked on
producing numerical sampling methods to determine stable states in multidimensional space.

My first year at Ohio State, I was awarded a university fellowship.
During my second year, I lectured and graded classes of
Introduction to Computer Programming in Java.

At Ohio State, I took courses in AI, databases, bioinformatics, algorithms,
computability and complexity, and operating systems. The smaller projects I
worked on varied from app development (iOS and Android), statistical analysis of biological
systems with R, and visualization techniques of those analyses with D3 and Tableau.

Some of my experience at OSU also includes bioinformatics software/packages
like GSEA, FastQC, Tophat, Cufflinks, with TCGA data and more.
