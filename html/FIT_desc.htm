<p class="paragraph1"> I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Florida Tech in Biomathematics in May of 2015. </p>

<p class="paragraph1">
I began my time at FIT taking classes in biological sciences, mathematics and
computer science. In the first year, I also joined the inaugural swim team.
I was the team captain of the swim team my first two years at FIT, as well as
placing as high as 10th at the SSC conference meet in the 100 yard breaststroke.

In academia, I began focusing in mathematical and biological courses.
I was awarded the Merit Scholar going into FIT. It was not until my second year
at FIT that I had any experience with coding. The first language I learned was
Java, and since then a genuine interest in using code to solve mathematical
biology problems has been the driving force in my career path.

<p class="paragraph1">
At Florida Tech I worked on a computational biology problem that involved
the simulation of the fluid dynamics of bleb formation in a cell.
The process of blebbing is the
detachment of the cell membrane from the cortex. This results in the interior
pressure forcing cytosol to flow through the cortex and push on the cell membrane.
The goal of this project was to produce a model that closely predicts the experimental
results, thus quantifying parameters that are not yet known, like the viscosity and
drag coefficient parameter values.
