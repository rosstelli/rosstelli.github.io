<p class="paragraph1">
Worked on a project titled
<em>
A Regulatory DNA Mismatch Repair Network and the Role of MicroRNAs</em>.
</p>

<p class="paragraph1">
Established a boolean model of genetic/protein network interactions of DNA mismatch repair.
The network was supported by literature with proteins and miRNAs highly involved in MMR.
Some highly involved miRNAs involved are miR-21 and miR-155, and to a lesser extent miR-17/92.
